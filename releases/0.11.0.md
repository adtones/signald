# signald 0.11.0

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.10.0...0.11.0)

This release brings libsignal up to date and adds basic support for groups v2. It also includes a number of new request types
and other features. 

There's been lots of great community contributions this release! Many thanks to all who helped out:
* [!19](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/19) *Tulir Asokan* fixed a critical bug that arose from the libsignal update. 
* [!26](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/26) *Lazlo Westerhof* added support for explicitly sending delivery receipts
* [!28](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/28) *Lazlo Westerhof* added support for sending typing start/stop messages.
* [!29](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/29) *Tulir Asokan* added support for retrieving the QR code data for fingerprints.
* [!30](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/30) *Toby Murray* provided some much-needed updates to the documentation.
* [!32](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/32) *Toby Murray* updated the `build.gradle` file.
* [!33](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/33) *Toby Murray* updated gradle to 6.7.1.
* [!37](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/37) *Toby Murray* cleaned up some build time warnings.
* [!38](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/38) *Tulir Asokan* added `listen_started` and `listen_stopped` messages to alert clients when signald is temporarily disconnected from the server.
* [!34](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/34) *Toby Murray* cleaned up the Dockerfile. Now the only volume that needs to be mounted is ` /signald`, which contains the state files, the attachments and the socket.
* [!39](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/39) *Kyle Copperfield* added CI jobs to build the zkgroups library on arm as well as `.deb` builds for aarch64 with the built library
* [!41](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/41) *io mintz* made the systemd unit file much cleaner

This release added support for v2 groups. v2 groups require a native library, written in rust, to function. This is currently
only available pre-built for 64-bit x86 Linux, but there is ongoing work on to add support for other platforms, primarily
Linux on armv7 (see [#85](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/85)). Eventually I hope to provide builds
for as many platforms as possible. There are hints that Signal is moving [all of its core functionality to rust](https://github.com/SignalApp/libsignal-client), so
the same library can be used by all platforms. This means being able to run the native libraries will become more and more
critical.

To send to a v2 group, simply provide a v2 group ID in the `recipientGroupId` field. Incoming requests have a new field
for v2 groups, which will include the group ID as well as the revision number, but no other data. Clients can make a
`list_groups` request to get the full group list, which will include metadata about the v2 groups. Group metadata can be
safely cached until the revision number changes, at which point `list_groups` will have the updated group metadata.

In addition to v2 groups, I've been experimenting a new request processing architecture and implemented a few request types
with it. There are a number of benefits to it, but the biggest to client developers will most likely be the new protocol
documentation.

The protocol documentation, at its core, this is simply a JSON document that describes the protocol to communicate with
signald. Most structures are documented, as well as a few request and response types. This should allow
partially-generated signald client libraries. To experiment, I have been working on a partially generated
[golang client](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald-go). It supports all new style request types and responses, and I've
successfully implemented a simple bot with it. Additionally, I was able to render a simple
[static documentation site](https://signald.org/), which gets updated automatically when changes are pushed to
signald.

This also changes how incoming requests are handled inside signald. Instead of long file with a giant switch statement
in it, the new structure has each request type as its own class.  This means that each request must declare a separate
list of arguments, including which ones are required. If required fields are missing, the request is rejected
before the code can run, improving the experience for the user while not requiring significantly more work from developers.
While only a few request types use this new system for now, more will be moved over soon.

##Some other important announcements
* signald's git repo will be moved to the signald organization shortly after this release. It will be available at
    https://gitlab.com/signald/signald.git
* signald's primary branch will be changed to `main` shortly after this release.
