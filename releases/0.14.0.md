## New Default Socket File Location

[*#66*](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/66)

In a future release (likely 0.15.0), the default path for the socket file will be `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/signald/signald.sock`.
To get this behavior now, launch signald with the `-u` flag. To supress the warning on startup while continuing to use
the system-wide socket path, launch signald with `--socket /var/run/signald/signald.sock`.

[Guidance for client authors about this change has been added to signald.org](https://signald.org/articles/socket-protocol/#socket-file-location).

## v0 protocol deprecation

v1 should support all functionality of v0. If I removed something important without providing an adequate replacement,
open an issue or otherwise get in touch.

This release officially deprecates the v0 protocol. debug-level log messages will be triggered every time signald receives
a v0 request. The removal date for the old protocol as stated in the log is end of 2021. If this is too soon, please
get in touch.

## other changes

* A CI step has been added to validate that incoming code does not alter the client protocol in backwards-incompatible ways.
* signald tries to send and receive sealed sender messages if possible ([!60](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/60)).
* server is now configurable at runtime and different accounts can be configured to use different servers ([!66](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/merge_requests/66))
  * previous method of setting a server at build time still works, but for smooth migration make sure to set `DEFAULT_SERVER_UUID`
    when building. It can be any valid UUID except the two preloaded server's fixed UUIDs. It should not change from build to build.
  * For more information, see [signald.org](https://signald.org/articles/servers/)
* aarch64 (armv8 or 64 bit arm) is now a supported platform for the debian repo. armv7 support is in the works but did not make it into this release.
* signald now supports systemd's `NOTIFY_SOCKET` feature ([#152](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/152)).
    The .service file distributed with signald has been to `Type=notify`
