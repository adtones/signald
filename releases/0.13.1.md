# signald 0.13.1

[see all code changes here](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/compare/0.13.0...0.13.1)

This patch release fixes two issues that were found in signald 0.13.0:
* [#150 Remote key change breaks signald](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/150) - it seems the new libsignal
doesn't include the key in UntrustedIdentityExceptions, leading to new keys not being handled well. This is worked
around by storing unknown keys when the `isTrustedIdentity()` callback is called for unknown keys.
* [#155 mark_read does not allow setting timestamp it was sent](https://gitlab.com/signald/signald/-/issues/155), fixes
a regression in v1 mark_read where the `"when"` field available in v0 was not available in v1. It is now available.
